# Sowing Taker Auto Bot

An automated farming bot designed to interact with the Taker Sowing Protocol. This bot helps automate daily sign-ins and farming activities to accumulate Taker Points, which may be valuable for future airdrops.

## Register

- Link : https://sowing.taker.xyz/?start=B81Z0GDR

## Features

- Automatic daily sign-ins
- Support for multiple wallets
- Proxy support for advanced users
- Real-time terminal UI with status updates
- Automatic token refreshing
- Countdown timers for next farming opportunities

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airdropinsiders/Sowing-Taker-Auto-Bot.git
cd Sowing-Taker-Auto-Bot
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your private keys:

```
PRIVATE_KEY_1=your_private_key_here
PRIVATE_KEY_2=another_private_key_here
# Add more as needed
```

4. (Optional) If you want to use proxies, create a `proxies.txt` file and add one proxy per line:

```
username:password@host:port
host:port:username:password
http://username:password@host:port
# Add more as needed
```

## Usage

Start the bot with:

```bash
npm start
```

### Controls

- **Q**: Quit the application
- **R**: Refresh authentication tokens
- **←**: Switch to previous wallet
- **→**: Switch to next wallet

## How It Works

1. The bot authenticates each wallet using Ethereum signatures
2. It performs daily sign-ins to earn Taker Points
3. The UI displays current points, consecutive sign-ins, and time until next farming opportunity
4. The bot automatically refreshes tokens when needed and keeps track of each wallet's status

## Security Notes

- Never share your `.env` file or private keys
- This bot runs locally and doesn't send your private keys to any external servers
- All signatures are created locally using the ethers.js library

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure your private keys are correctly formatted
2. Check if your proxies (if used) are working properly
3. Ensure you have a stable internet connection
4. Try refreshing tokens using the **R** key
